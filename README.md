Two Sum Function

For this [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) challenge, write a two sum function. A two sum function takes in an array or list of numbers and a target value and returns the indices of two numbers if their sum is equal to the target number. 

The user inputs a list/array of numbers, each separated by a "space", and clicks the button to evaluate it. Additionally, if the input does not fit the criteria for evaluation, the user is prompted to try again. 

#### NOTE: 
The form automatically resets 3 seconds after the numbers are evaluated.

#### FILES: 
There are two JavaScript files. Main.js contains the function and additional coding neccessary to connect to the html. Two-Sum.js has the plain function.

### What I learned

Understanding the "two sum" function was a challenge, initially. I had to figure out how to use objects and arrays together. Implementing a dashboard that would give the user feedback was challenging.
